  "synthesis": "## Relevant Legal Principles and Statutes\nThe City of Toronto issues parking violation notices to enforce City parking bylaws and regulations and to reduce traffic congestion. These notices are issued when a vehicle is parked in breach of a parking/standing or stopping bylaw contained in the City of Toronto Municipal Code. \n\n## Application to Client's Situation\nIn your situation, you were fined for parking in the wrong spot near the CN Tower, but you believe you parked at the right time. It is important to note that parking violation notices are issued based on parking location, regardless of the time of day. Therefore, parking at the \"right time\" may not be a valid defense against the violation notice. \n\nTo better understand your specific situation, the following information would be helpful:\n- Were there any signs indicating parking restrictions in the area where you parked?\n- Were there any extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to the violation?\n- Have you received similar violation notices in the past, and if so, were they disputed or paid?\n\n## Next Steps and Considerations\nWithin 15 days of receiving the parking violation notice, you can request a screening review. This review process allows you to dispute the notice and provide any relevant information or evidence that may support your case. During this review, you can present your argument that you parked at the right time and were unfairly fined.\n\nIt is important to note that if you have already paid the fine, you cannot dispute the violation. The City of Toronto's policy states that once a full or partial payment is made, the matter is no longer eligible for dispute. Therefore, if you wish to dispute the violation, do not make any payments towards the fine.\n\nTo initiate the screening review, you will need to provide the following information:\n- Violation notice date\n- License plate number (especially if you are a non-Ontario license plate holder)\n- Violation number\n\nYou can check the status of your parking violation and initiate the screening review online at toronto.ca. Alternatively, you can choose to pay the fine online, by mail, or in person. However, paying the fine would waive your right to dispute the violation notice.\n\n## Limitations and Further Research\nThis analysis assumes that the parking violation notice was issued correctly and that there were no procedural errors or extenuating circumstances. It is also important to note that the City of Toronto's parking regulations and dispute processes may change over time, so ensuring you have the most up-to-date information is crucial.",
