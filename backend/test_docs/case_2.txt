    SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
    
    COMPANY 2 v. SMITH ENTERPRISES
    
    Decided: January 15, 2023
    
    JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.
    
    This case concerns the interpretation of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. 
    The question presented is whether an internet platform can be held liable for content 
    created by its users when the platform has used algorithmic processes to promote that content.
    
    We hold that Section 230 immunity applies even when a platform uses algorithms to recommend content, 
    so long as the underlying content was created by a third party. The judgment of the Court of Appeals 
    is affirmed.
