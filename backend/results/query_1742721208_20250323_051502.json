    "synthesis": "## Relevant Legal Principles, Statutes, and Regulations\nThe following legal principles, statutes, and regulations are relevant to the client's query:\n- 8 CFR \u00a7 204.5 - Petitions for employment-based immigrants: This statute outlines the requirement for filing a petition to classify an alien under specific sections of the Act, using Form I-140.\n- 8 U.S. Code \u00a7 1101 - Definitions: This statute defines a \"nonimmigrant visa\" as a visa issued to an alien as an eligible nonimmigrant.\n- H-1B Visa Program: The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa category that allows employers to hire highly educated foreign professionals in specialty occupations, including fields like mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical sciences.\n- Employment-Based Immigration: Second Preference EB-2: This category is for members of professions holding advanced degrees or their equivalent or individuals with exceptional ability.\n\n## Application Process and Eligibility Criteria for H-1B and EB-2 Visas\n### H-1B Visa:\n**Application Process**:\n1. Employer/Agent submits a Labor Condition Application (LCA) to the Department of Labor (DOL) for certification.\n2. The employer/agent must receive DOL certification, which includes attestations to ensure the protection of U.S. and nonimmigrant workers.\n3. The employer/agent submits Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, to USCIS, along with the DOL-certified LCA.\n4. Prospective workers outside the U.S. apply for a visa and/or admission by approaching the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad.\n5. The worker must then apply to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for admission to the U.S. in H-1B classification.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria**:\n- The H-1B visa is for specialty occupations that require at least a bachelor's degree or its equivalent.\n- The employer must attest that hiring a foreign worker will not negatively impact U.S. workers' wages and working conditions.\n- The employer must notify existing workers of their intention to hire an H-1B worker.\n- The prospective H-1B worker must not possess a controlling interest in the petitioning organization or entity (owning less than 50%).\n\n### EB-2 Visa:\n**Application Process**:\n1. The employer files Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, on behalf of the applicant, along with a signed U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)-approved Form ETA-9089, Application for Permanent Employment Certification.\n2. If eligible, the applicant may self-petition by filing Form I-140 and providing evidence of national interest.\n3. If the petition is approved, the applicant's spouse and unmarried children under 21 may be eligible for admission to the U.S.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria**:\n- The EB-2 visa is for members of professions holding advanced degrees (beyond a bachelor's degree) or a bachelor's degree with at least five years of progressive experience in the specialty.\n- The occupation must be a profession that typically requires a bachelor's degree for entry.\n- The applicant must provide evidence of their qualifications, such as degrees, experience, exceptional ability, or national importance of their proposed endeavor.\n\n## Recent Policy Changes\n### H-1B Visa:\n- Beginning in FY 2025, USCIS shifted from an employer-based to a beneficiary-centric registration system to prevent potential gaming of the system by bad actors.\n- The Department of Labor withdrew its Notice from the Federal Register in January 2021 and is reviewing related issues of law, fact, and policy.\n\n### EB-2 Visa:\n- As of June 1, 2023, labor certification applications can be filed using the DOL's Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system, resulting in an approved and signed Form ETA-9089, Final Determination \u2013 Permanent Employment Certification Approval.\n\n## Practical Considerations for Employers Sponsoring Foreign Workers\nWhen sponsoring foreign workers on H-1B or EB-2 visas, employers should be aware of the following:\n- H-1B Visa:\n   - The H-1B visa is temporary, typically allowing admission for up to 3 years, with possible extensions up to 6 years.\n   - Employers must ensure they do not adversely affect U.S. workers' wages and working conditions and must notify existing workers of their intention to hire an H-1B worker.\n   - Employers are responsible for the reasonable costs of the worker's return transportation if they terminate employment before the authorized stay ends.\n- EB-2 Visa:\n   - The EB-2 visa is for advanced degree holders or those with exceptional ability and is part of the employment-based immigrant visa program.\n   - Employers must file Form I-140 and ensure labor certification requirements are met, unless a national interest waiver applies.\n\n## Limitations and Further Research\nThis analysis is based on the provided sources and may not cover all aspects of the H-1B and EB-2 visa processes. Further research may be needed to address specific scenarios or considerations, such as recent case law or agency guidance.\n\n## Next Steps for the Client\nBased on the information provided, the client should:\n- Understand the eligibility requirements for H-1B and EB-2 visas and assess whether they meet the criteria.\n- Familiarize themselves with the application process, including the required forms and certifications (LCA, Form I-129, Form I-140).\n- Be aware of recent policy changes, such as the shift to a beneficiary-centric registration system for H-1B visas and the updated labor certification process for EB-2 visas.\n- Consider the practical implications of sponsoring foreign workers, including potential costs and the need to ensure compliance with labor conditions and wage requirements.",
