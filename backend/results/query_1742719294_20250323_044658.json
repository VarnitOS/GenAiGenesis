    "synthesis": "**Relevant Legal Principles, Statutes, Regulations, and Cases**\n\nPolicy 71 of the University of Waterloo's Secretariat outlines the institution's approach to student discipline, encompassing both academic and non-academic misconduct. The policy emphasizes the University's commitment to academic integrity and fairness, with penalties based on the Guidelines for Assessment of Penalties, the Framework for the Assessment of Undergraduate Plagiarism, and the Framework for the Assessment of Unauthorized Collaboration Involving Undergraduate Students. \n\n**Application to the Client's Situation**\n\nIf you have been accused of a Policy 71 violation, you are entitled to a presumption of innocence and a fair disciplinary process. The University considers the balance of probabilities in deciding guilt and determining penalties. You may face consequences such as a suspension, which restricts your right to register for courses, attend lectures, write exams, or graduate. A suspension note will be visible on your transcript. \n\n**Practical Next Steps and Considerations**\n\nHere are the steps you can expect in the disciplinary process: \n\n1. **Informal Resolution Proposal**: You may be able to resolve the matter informally with your instructor or the Associate Dean. \n2. **Formal Investigation**: If the matter proceeds formally, you will receive a Policy 71 allegation by email. The Associate Dean will investigate and consider the evidence, including any mitigating or aggravating factors you present. \n3. **Discipline Decision**: The Associate Dean will issue a decision and outline any penalties. \n4. **Appeal**: If you disagree with the decision or penalty, you have 10 working days to submit an appeal under Policy 72 \u2013 Student Appeals. \n\n**Limitations and Further Research**\n\nIt is important to review the specific details of your case, the policies referenced above, and any additional University policies or guidelines related to discipline and academic integrity. You may also consider seeking support from the University's resources, such as the Conflict Management and Human Rights Office, Student Resource Office, or Counselling Services. \n\n**Disclaimer**: This response is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Please consult with a legal professional for specific guidance regarding your situation.",
