    "synthesis": "## Relevant Legal Principles, Statutes, and Regulations\n\n- New York's real property laws: These laws outline the information that must be disclosed in lease agreements, including leasing requirements, landlord and tenant responsibilities and rights, and other legal details. Lease agreements should be drafted for tenancies longer than 12 months, and landlords are advised to create a document even for shorter lease terms to avoid legal issues.\n- New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal: This agency provides information on leases, security deposits, roommates, sublets, and more.\n- New York City Human Rights Law: Prohibits landlords from discriminating against tenants based on protected characteristics such as age, immigration status, disability, gender, race, religion, etc.\n- Good Cause Eviction (GCE): A recent amendment to the Real Property Law and the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. GCE prevents landlords from evicting tenants without a \"good cause\" specified in the statute, and it applies to many unregulated apartments in New York City and other participating municipalities in the state.\n- Rent Control and Rent Stabilization: New York has two types of rent regulation. Rent control limits the rent charged for residential buildings constructed before February 1947 in municipalities that have not ended the postwar rental housing emergency. Rent stabilization applies to buildings with a certain number of units, construction dates before 1974, or special tax benefits.\n- Tenant's Rights to Complaints and Repairs: Tenants have the right to complain about their living conditions to the landlord or a government agency without retaliation. If a landlord fails to address necessary repairs, tenants may have the right to repair and deduct the costs from future rent payments.\n\n## Application to Client's Situation\n\nAs a tenant in New York, you have various rights that vary depending on the type of apartment you live in (rent-regulated, government-subsidized, or unregulated) and your location within the state. Here are some of your potential rights:\n\n- **Non-Discrimination**: Landlords cannot discriminate against you based on protected characteristics such as age, immigration status, disability, gender, race, religion, etc.\n- **Eviction Protections**: Your landlord cannot evict you without a court process and a \"good cause.\" They cannot physically remove you or your belongings before receiving a court order authorizing eviction.\n- **Rent Control or Stabilization**: If you live in a rent-controlled apartment, your rent is subject to limits, and your landlord's ability to evict you is restricted. Rent stabilization applies to specific buildings based on construction date, number of units, and special tax benefits.\n- **Complaints and Repairs**: You have the right to complain about your living conditions without retaliation. If necessary repairs are not addressed by your landlord, you may be able to exercise repair and deduct rights.\n- **Roommates and Subletting**: You have the right to live with one non-familial roommate and their dependent children. If there are multiple tenants on the lease, the number of roommates cannot exceed the number of tenants. While you must ask for consent to assign or sublease your apartment, the landlord cannot unreasonably withhold consent.\n- **Organizing as a Tenant Group**: You have the right to organize and meet with other tenants to discuss building conditions, harassment, or other issues.\n- **Additional Rights for Public Housing Tenants**: If you live in public housing, your landlord cannot charge you more than 30% of your income in rent, and you have the right to adjust your rent if your income changes.\n\n## Limitations and Further Research\n\nThe specific rights applicable to your situation may depend on various factors, including the type of apartment, your location within New York, and the terms of your lease agreement. While New York City has its own set of tenant rights and regulations, the laws can also vary depending on the county or town. Therefore, further research may be needed to determine the precise rights applicable to your specific circumstances.\n\n## Practical Next Steps\n\n- Review your lease agreement to understand the specific terms and conditions of your tenancy.\n- Contact the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal to determine if your apartment is rent-regulated and to learn more about your rights regarding leases, security deposits, roommates, and sublets.\n- Familiarize yourself with the New York City Human Rights Law and other relevant laws to understand your protections against discrimination and eviction.\n- If you have concerns about your living conditions, exercise your right to make a complaint to your landlord or a government agency.\n- If necessary repairs are not being addressed, research your options for repair and deduct rights to improve your living conditions.\n- Remember that you have the right to organize with other tenants to address building-wide issues.\n- If you need further clarification or assistance, consider contacting Legal Services NYC or seeking legal advice from an attorney.",

    "response": " New York City is known for its vibrant culture, diverse communities, and unique renting situations. As a tenant living in New York, you have certain rights and protections provided by state and local laws. Here's a simplified overview of key rights you enjoy as a tenant in New York:\n\n1. Non-Discrimination: Landlords are prohibited from discriminating against potential tenants based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, religion, disability, age, or immigration status. This protection extends to rental applications, lease agreements, and any other aspect of the rental process.\n\n2. Eviction Protections: Your landlord cannot evict you without a valid reason (such as non-payment of rent, violation of lease terms, or the owner intending to use the property themselves) and following proper legal procedures, which include serving notices and obtaining a court order. Landlords cannot arbitrarily evict you or force you to move out.\n\n3. Rent Regulations: Depending on the type of apartment you live in, you may have rent control or rent stabilization protections. These regulations limit how much a landlord can increase your rent and provide safeguards against arbitrary evictions. Rent control applies to older apartments, while rent stabilization covers specific buildings constructed before 1974.\n\n4. Complaints and Repairs: You have the right to communicate concerns about necessary repairs or unsafe living conditions to your landlord or a relevant government agency. Landlords are responsible for maintaining the premises and must make necessary repairs within a reasonable time. If they fail to do so, you may be able to arrange for the repairs yourself and deduct the cost from the rent.\n\n5. Roommates and Subletting: In most cases, your lease agreement outlines the rules regarding roommates and subletting. You often have the right to live with one non-familial roommate, but it's best to check your lease and local guidelines. Subletting often requires the landlord's consent, which they cannot unreasonably withhold.\n\n6. Organizing Tenant Groups: You have the right to organize and join with other tenants to discuss and advocate for better building conditions, harassment complaints, or other issues affecting you as a tenant.\n\n7. Fair Housing Opportunities: The City of New York promotes fair housing opportunities. Landlords cannot discriminate or withhold housing based on a prospective tenant's source of income, such as Section 8 vouchers. \n\n8. Notice Requirements: Landlords must provide tenants with notice of lease violations and sufficient time to remedy the issue",
