  "synthesis": "## Relevant Legal Principles and Statutes\n\nParking violation notices in Toronto are issued to reduce traffic congestion and enforce City parking bylaws and regulations. These bylaws are applied whether or not a sign is posted, and parking violation notices are issued when a vehicle is parked in breach of a parking/standing or stopping bylaw.\n\n## Application to the Client's Situation\n\nIn this case, the client received a $100 fine for parking in the wrong spot near the CN Tower, despite parking at the right time. It is important to note that parking at the wrong time and in the wrong place are two distinct violations, and the client may still be liable for the fine, depending on the specific circumstances.\n\n## Next Steps and Considerations\n\nThe client has a few options to consider:\n\n1. **Dispute the parking violation** - Within 15 days of receiving the parking violation notice, the client can request a screening review. This option is only available if the violation has not already been paid, as disputes cannot be made once payment has been submitted.\n2. **Request more time to pay or dispute** - If the client missed the 15-day deadline, they may be able to request more time to pay or dispute the notice if there are extenuating circumstances.\n3. **Pay the fine** - The client can choose to pay the $100 fine online, by mail, or in person. Payment methods include cash, cheque, money order, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or debit card.\n\n## Limitations and Further Research\n\nIt is important to note that the information provided here is based on the assumption that the client's vehicle was parked within the city of Toronto, where the above-mentioned bylaws and regulations apply. If the vehicle was parked outside the city limits, further research into the relevant municipal or regional laws may be necessary.",
