MAJORITY OPINION

The Court holds that the state university's admissions program, which considers race as one factor in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body, does not satisfy strict scrutiny because its implementation is not narrowly tailored to achieve this goal.

The Court emphasizes that any use of race in admissions must be narrowly tailored and subject to strict scrutiny. The Court finds that while diversity can constitute a compelling state interest, the university's program fails to employ race-neutral alternatives effectively.

The Court notes that quotas and racial balancing are unconstitutional, and that universities must demonstrate good faith consideration of race-neutral alternatives.

MAJORITY OPINION

This case presents an important question of employment discrimination law: whether a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination solely with evidence of pay disparity between similarly situated employees of different genders.

The Court holds that while pay disparity is relevant evidence, it is not by itself sufficient to establish a prima facie case. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that the employer's explanation for the disparity is pretextual.

The Court notes that statistical evidence may be compelling when showing systematic discrimination across a workforce, but individualized assessment is required for specific claims.

The plaintiff in this case has shown both pay disparity and evidence suggesting the employer's justification was pretextual, and therefore has established a prima facie case that should proceed to trial.

MAJORITY OPINION

This case concerns allegations of discrimination in municipal hiring practices. The plaintiff alleges that the city's standardized testing requirement for firefighter positions has a disparate impact on minority applicants and is not job-related.

The Court applies the disparate impact framework established in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. Under this framework, once a plaintiff demonstrates that a facially neutral employment practice has a disparate impact on a protected group, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the practice is job-related and consistent with business necessity.

The evidence in this case establishes that the standardized test has a statistically significant disparate impact on minority applicants. The city has failed to demonstrate that the test accurately predicts job performance or is necessary for safe and efficient operations.

The Court therefore holds that the city's testing requirement violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and orders the city to develop alternative selection procedures that both serve legitimate business needs and minimize adverse impact on protected groups.

(2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
(3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.

(c) Applying general title VII principles, an employer, employment agency, joint apprenticeship committee or labor organization (hereinafter collectively referred to as "employer") is responsible for its acts and those of its agents and supervisory employees with respect to sexual harassment regardless of whether the specific acts complained of were authorized or even forbidden by the employer and regardless of whether the employer knew or should have known of their occurrence.

(a) In general. The equal pay provisions apply to any employer who pays different wages to employees of opposite sexes for equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions in the same establishment. The employer against whom a charge is lodged or a suit brought has the burden of proving that a factor other than sex is the basis for the wage differential.

(b) "Establishment." The prohibition against compensation discrimination under the equal pay provisions applies only to wage differentials as between employees in the same establishment. An "establishment" is a distinct physical place of business rather than an entire business or "enterprise" which may include several separate places of business. Accordingly, each physical location is a separate establishment.

(c) Application to jobs. The equal pay provisions of the Act apply to jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions within the same establishment. Where these factors are the same, the Act requires that men and women performing equal work must receive the same rate of pay. The job content, not the job title or classification, determines the equality of jobs. Application of the equal pay standard is not dependent on job classifications or titles but depends rather on actual job requirements and performance.
