To determine which tax bracket you fall into, you need to know your filing status and taxable income.

For tax year 2023, the federal income tax brackets are:

For Single filers:
- 10% for incomes up to $11,000
- 12% for incomes over $11,000 to $44,725
- 22% for incomes over $44,725 to $95,375
- 24% for incomes over $95,375 to $182,100
- 32% for incomes over $182,100 to $231,250
- 35% for incomes over $231,250 to $578,125
- 37% for incomes over $578,125

For Married Filing Jointly:
- 10% for incomes up to $22,000
- 12% for incomes over $22,000 to $89,450
- 22% for incomes over $89,450 to $190,750
- 24% for incomes over $190,750 to $364,200
- 32% for incomes over $364,200 to $462,500
- 35% for incomes over $462,500 to $693,750
- 37% for incomes over $693,750

Remember that the U.S. has a progressive tax system, meaning you don't pay a single rate on your entire income. Instead, you pay the rate for each bracket only on the income that falls within that bracket's range.

To get the most accurate determination of your tax bracket, you should consult with a tax professional or use tax preparation software that can account for all of your specific circumstances, including deductions and credits.
